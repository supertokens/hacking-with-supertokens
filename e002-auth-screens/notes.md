## Goals for today

- Auth screen using what we have in the SuperTokens docs
  - We'll literally copy/paste our way to a working auth server and client side functions for auth
- We'll tweak Vite to allow us multiple static entry points
- We'll create a couple of components to show the auth screen (email, password) and a dashboard component (for our logged-in path)
- Finally, we'll compile that into a JS file and try it out in some html files
